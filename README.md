## Overview

The **Data Visualization Tool** is a Jupyter notebook-based utility designed to simplify the process of visualizing data using Python's popular libraries. This tool allows users to create insightful and interactive visualizations, making it easier to understand and communicate data trends, patterns, and distributions.

### Features
- üìä Supports various chart types including line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps.
- üìà Utilizes well-known Python libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for creating static and interactive visualizations.
- üõ†Ô∏è User-friendly interface with step-by-step instructions to guide you through data visualization processes.
- üé® Customizable visual elements to tailor plots according to specific requirements, such as labels, colors, styles, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Data Visualization Tool, make sure you have the following software and libraries installed:
- **Python 3.x**: The tool requires Python, preferably version 3.6 or higher.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The notebook can be run on your local machine or on a cloud-based platform like **Google Colab**.

### How to Use Google Colab
You can use the tool on Google Colab without needing to install anything locally:
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gQGLVXLzLa1-lQPxOD_ttfcrl_S4emAF?usp=sharing).
2. Upload the notebook file (`DataVIZ_Tool.ipynb`) directly to Colab.
3. Install the required libraries by running the installation commands in the Colab cells.

### Required Libraries
The notebook relies on several Python libraries for data analysis and visualization. You can install all required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
